There points may represent:\n\n-   **Events**, such as crimes, road accidents, or disease occurrences, or\n\n-   **Service and facility locations**, including shops (e.g., cafes, supermarkets) and community facilities like childcare or aged care centres.\n\n**First-order** **Spatial Point Pattern Analysis** (1-st SPPA) examines the intensity or density of points across a study area. It identifies spatial trends in point distribution without considering interaction between points helping to answer questions like:\n\n-   Where are points most concentrated?\n\n-   Is density uniform or variable?\n\n-   How dispersed is the pattern?\n\n> In this exercise, the [**spatsat**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/) is utilised to apply two common 1st-SPPA methods to explore:\n>\n> 1.  Whether childcare centres in Singapore are randomly distributed;\n>\n> 2.  If not, identifying areas with higher concentrations of centres.\n\n# The Data\n\nThe following datasets were downloaded from publicly available websites, and both are available in KML and GeoJSON format.\n\n| Dataset Name | Source | Discrption |\n|------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Child Care Services | [data.gov.sg](data.gov.sg) | **Point feature data**: contains the locations and attributes of childcare centres. |\n| Master plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) | [singstat](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/) | **Polygon feature data**: represents the URA 2019 Master Plan planning subzone boundaries. |\n\n# Installing and Loading the R Packages\n\nIn addition to *spatstat*, a total of five R packages will be used in this exercise.\n\n| Package | Discription |\n|------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|\n| [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) | Simple Features, a new R package which handles importing, managing, and processing vector-based geospatial data. |\n| [spatstat](https://spatstat.org/) | Provides useful functions for SPPA, which will be called to conduct both 1st and 2nd SPPA and KDE. |\n| [terra](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html) | Modern package for raster/vector spatial data and will be used to convert spastat outputs into terra format. |\n| [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) | Creates high quality static or interactive choropleth maps via [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). |\n| [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) | Scrapes and extracts data from web pages. |\n\nAfter installation, we load them into R environment using the code below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman:: p_load(sf, terra, spatstat, tmap, rvest, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Importing and Wrangling Geospatial Data Sets\n",
